  description: |
    This template detects the use of biometric or fingerprint permissions in the Android application. The presence of `USE_FINGERPRINT` or `USE_BIOMETRIC` permissions indicates that the application uses fingerprint or other biometric data for authentication purposes. This information can help determine if the app is utilizing modern authentication methods for enhanced security.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that biometric authentication is implemented following best practices to prevent spoofing attacks. Use the latest `BiometricPrompt` API to leverage enhanced security features provided by Android for biometric authentication.
