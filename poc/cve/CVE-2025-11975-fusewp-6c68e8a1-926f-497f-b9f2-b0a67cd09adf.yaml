    FuseWP – WordPress User Sync to Email List & Marketing Automation (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, ActiveCampaign etc.) <= 1.1.23.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sync Rule Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The FuseWP – WordPress User Sync to Email List & Marketing Automation (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, ActiveCampaign etc.) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_changes() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and edit sync rules.
