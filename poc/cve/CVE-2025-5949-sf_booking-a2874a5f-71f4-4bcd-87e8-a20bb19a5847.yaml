info:
  name: >
    Service Finder Bookings <= 6.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via change_candidate_password
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to processing a password change request. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher to reset other users' passwords, including those of admins.
