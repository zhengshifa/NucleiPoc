    AppPresser – Mobile App Framework <= 4.5.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Limited Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The AppPresser – Mobile App Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'myappp_verify' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including plugin and theme names and version numbers, which can be used to facilitate targeted attacks against outdated or vulnerable components.
