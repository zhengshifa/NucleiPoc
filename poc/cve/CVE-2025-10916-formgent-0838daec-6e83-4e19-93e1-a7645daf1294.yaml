    FormGent – Next-Gen AI Form Builder for WordPress with Multi-Step, Quizzes, Payments & More < 1.0.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The FormGent – Next-Gen AI Form Builder for WordPress with Multi-Step, Quizzes, Payments & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wp-json/formgent/responses/attachments REST endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
