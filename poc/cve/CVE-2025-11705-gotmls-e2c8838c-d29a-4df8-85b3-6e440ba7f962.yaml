    Anti-Malware Security and Brute-Force Firewall <= 4.23.81 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Anti-Malware Security and Brute-Force Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 4.23.81 due to a missing capability check combined with an information exposure in several GOTMLS_* AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
