info:
  name: >
    WPC Name Your Price for WooCommerce <= 2.1.9 - Unauthenticated Price Alteration
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WPC Name Your Price for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized price alteration in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.9. This is due to the plugin not disabling the ability to name a custom price when it has been specifically disabled for a product. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to purchase products at prices less than they should be able to.
