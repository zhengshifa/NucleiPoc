    Post SMTP – Complete SMTP Solution with Logs, Alerts, Backup SMTP & Mobile App <= 3.6.0 - Missing Authorization to Account Takeover via Unauthenticated Email Log Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Post SMTP – Complete SMTP Solution with Logs, Alerts, Backup SMTP & Mobile App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the __construct function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary logged emails sent through the Post SMTP plugin, including password reset emails containing password reset links, which can lead to account takeover.
